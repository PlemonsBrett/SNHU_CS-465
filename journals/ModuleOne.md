# Module One Journal Entry

**Date:** 10 May, 2025

**Course:** SNHU CS-465 Full Stack Web Development

**Student:** Brett Plemons

**Assignment:** Module One Journal Entry

## Journal Prompt

In this module, you have been introduced to full stack web development, and more specifically the MEAN stack. Full stack development is iterative and will require you to see the “big picture” while working on fine details, and to understand how various pieces fit together. Building a full stack application is a rigorous experience that takes patience, attention to detail, and a keen ability to trouble-shoot.

Due to the nature of this type of development, it is helpful to take time to reflect and check in with your instructor regularly. Write a journal entry to your instructor to reflect on what went well and what challenges you faced this week. Consider the following in your reflection:

- What were the most challenging aspects of the installation process for you?
- How would you gauge your level of experience with HTML and JavaScript after the tutorial?
- How would you sum up Module One?

## Journal Entry

### Installation Process Reflection

The installation process for setting up the MEAN stack environment was straightforward due to my extensive experience with Node.js over the past decade. Rather than following a step-by-step tutorial, I leveraged my knowledge to establish a project structure aligned with industry best practices.
I focused on creating a robust mono-repo architecture using pnpm, which allows for better dependency management and project organization. Additionally, I implemented several code quality enforcement tools, including:

- Biome for linting and formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Commitlint for enforcing conventional commit messages
- Automated changelogs and semantic versioning
- Shared TypeScript, Biome, and Jest configurations
These tools help maintain code quality and consistency throughout the development process, which is crucial for larger projects.

### HTML and JavaScript Experience

Having worked with Node.js, TypeScript, and React for over 10 years, my experience with HTML and JavaScript is extensive. Setting up a simple Express server to serve static HTML content was a routine task that required minimal effort. My focus was more on establishing a solid foundation for the project with proper architecture and tooling rather than learning the basics of these technologies.
The implementation demonstrates my understanding of modern JavaScript practices, including ES modules, middleware configuration, and proper error handling in an Express application.

### Module One Summary

Module One served as a refresher rather than a learning experience for me. It allowed me to apply my existing knowledge while exploring more efficient approaches to common development challenges. I particularly relished setting up the project infrastructure, focusing on maintainability and developer experience, which is a testament to my passion for this field.
The comprehensive documentation I added, including Contributing guidelines, License information, and detailed READMEs, reflects my understanding of what makes a professional, production-ready project. While I didn't encounter significant technical challenges, I found immense value in refining my approach to project setup and organization, demonstrating my commitment to continuous improvement.
Looking forward to the upcoming modules, I'm eager to see how the course will address more complex aspects of full-stack development and whether there will be opportunities to implement more advanced features beyond the basic requirements. This anticipation reflects my eagerness to learn and grow in this field.
